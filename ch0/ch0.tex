\chapter{Uncertainty in Complex Systems: The Role of Fuzzy Logic}
\label{ch:intro}


Before stating a proper formalization of the fuzzy framework, it is crucial to first clarify what it represents and why there is a need for such a theory when there already exists Probability and Statistics, which are broadly applied and much more developed.\\

The main objective of these frameworks is to represent and manage uncertainty inherent in complex systems. This involves encoding data and expressing information through appropriate mathematical structures and developing measures that enable effective synthesis and combination of uncertain information.\\

A fundamental motivation for modeling uncertainty is to enable better decision making across diverse domains. In engineering, uncertainty quantification helps assess structural reliability and optimize designs. In finance, it aids risk management and portfolio optimization. In medicine, it supports diagnosis and treatment planning under incomplete information. In environmental science, it helps model climate patterns and ecological systems. By developing mathematical frameworks to represent and reason about uncertainty, we can make more informed choices and balance competing objectives in complex scenarios.\\

\section{Structure of this work}

This work follows a logical progression from conceptual foundations to a practical application of fuzzy sets. \textbf{Chapter 1} established the context by examining uncertainty and identifying vagueness as a key challenge that traditional frameworks struggle to address, thus motivating the fuzzy paradigm. Building on this foundation, \textbf{Chapter 2} develops the theoretical framework systematically by presenting Fuzzy Set Theory, including its core definitions, operational tools such as t-norms, extensions to fuzzy relations and numbers, as well as briefly introducing the concepts of Possibility distributions and fuzzy propositional logic. \textbf{Chapter 3} explores Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), detailing methods for converting qualitative information into fuzzy format (fuzzification) and combining multiple criteria into coherent evaluations (aggregation). \textbf{Chapter 4} presents a comprehensive case study of a complex maintenance scheduling problem which leverages fuzzy MCDM concepts and techniques. The \textbf{appendices} contain supplementary technical material regarding analytical properties of t-norms and connections between algebraic structures and fuzzy logic.
