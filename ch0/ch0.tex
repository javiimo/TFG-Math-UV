\chapter{Uncertainty in Complex Systems: The Role of Fuzzy Logic}


Before stating a proper formalization of the fuzzy framework, it is crucial to first clarify what it represents and why there is a need for such a theory when there already exists Probability and Statistics, which are broadly applied and much more developed.\\

The main objective of these frameworks is to represent and manage uncertainty inherent in complex systems. This involves encoding data and expressing information through appropriate mathematical structures and developing measures that enable effective synthesis and combination of uncertain information.\\

A fundamental motivation for modeling uncertainty is to enable better decision making across diverse domains. In engineering, uncertainty quantification helps assess structural reliability and optimize designs. In finance, it aids risk management and portfolio optimization. In medicine, it supports diagnosis and treatment planning under incomplete information. In environmental science, it helps model climate patterns and ecological systems. By developing mathematical frameworks to represent and reason about uncertainty, we can make more informed choices and balance competing objectives in complex scenarios.\\
