The fuzzy sets that have been studied in this chapter are the original definition from Zadeh in \cite{Zadeh1965}, also known as type-1. However, different problems have motivated the definition of variations of these fuzzy sets leading to a long list of fuzzy sets. The main approaches include the following:

% \paragraph{Increasing membership dimensionality:} Instead of considering only a membership function with one component $\mu(x)$, it can be expanded multiple components. Each of them may have a different meaning and extra constraints might be imposed that relate different components. A popular example is intuitionistic,... But also (all the other that are less popular)...


% \paragraph{Modifying the structure of the membership value:} Changing the $[0,1]$ domain for something else. L-fuzzy sets from Goguen or hesitant fuzzy sets or interval valued

% \paragraph{Higher orders of uncertainty:} Rather than having a precise membership value, we might want to address the uncertainty regarding that value as well. For example type-2,... or using intervals... also type-n can be defined...

% \paragraph{Integrating with other uncertainty frameworks: } Integration with rough sets or soft sets

\paragraph{Increasing membership dimensionality:} Instead of considering only a membership function with one component $\mu(x)$, it can be expanded multiple components. Each of them may have a different meaning and extra constraints might be imposed that relate different components. A popular example is intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) \cite{Atanassov1986}, which define membership through two components: a degree of membership $\mu(x)$ and a degree of non-membership $\nu(x)$, satisfying $\mu(x) + \nu(x) \leq 1$, with the remainder representing hesitation. Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS) \cite{Yager2013_Pythagorean} offer a similar two-component structure but with a relaxed constraint $\mu(x)^2 + \nu(x)^2 \leq 1$, allowing for a broader representation of uncertainty. But also q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (q-ROFS) \cite{Yager2017_qRung} that further generalize this constraint, Spherical Fuzzy Sets (SFS) \cite{GundogduKahraman2019_Spherical} which add an indeterminacy component under a spherical constraint, Picture Fuzzy Sets (PiFS) \cite{Cuong2013_Picture} with positive, neutral, and negative memberships, Neutrosophic Sets (NS) \cite{Smarandache1998_Neutrosophic, Wang2010_SVNS} characterized by truth, indeterminacy, and falsity, Bipolar Fuzzy Sets \cite{Zhang1994_Bipolar} handling positive and negative aspects (with extensions like Bipolar Complex or Bipolar Spherical Fuzzy Sets), Plithogenic Sets \cite{Smarandache2018_Plithogenic} dealing with multiple attributes and their appurtenance/contradiction degrees,  and Multipolar Fuzzy Sets (m-Polar Fuzzy Sets) \cite{Chen2014_mPolar} extend these multi-dimensional ideas.

\paragraph{Modifying the structure of the membership value:} Changing the $[0,1]$ domain for something else. L-fuzzy sets from Goguen \cite{Goguen1967}, which generalize type-1 fuzzy sets by allowing membership grades to be drawn from an arbitrary lattice L instead of just $[0,1]$, provide an order-theoretic abstraction. Another example is hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS) \cite{Torra2010}, where the membership of an element is a set of several possible values in $[0,1]$, directly modeling hesitation among different membership degrees. The concept of interval-valued fuzzy sets, where the membership degree itself is an interval within $[0,1]$, such as, in the definition of components for Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets \cite{AtanassovGargov1989}.

\paragraph{Higher orders of uncertainty:} Rather than having a precise membership value, we might want to address the uncertainty regarding that value as well. For example type-2 fuzzy sets \cite{Zadeh1975}, where the membership grade of an element is itself a fuzzy set (often a fuzzy number) over $[0,1]$, capture this higher-order uncertainty. A widely used simplification is Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets \cite{Zadeh1975}, where this secondary membership footprint is an interval, directly representing the uncertainty about the primary membership with a range of possible values. Also type-n fuzzy sets \cite{Turksen1986_TypeNRelated} can be defined, which generalize this by defining membership as a fuzzy set of Type-($n-1$), though these are primarily of theoretical interest.

\paragraph{Integration with other uncertainty frameworks:} The combination with rough sets, leading to Rough Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Rough Sets \cite{DuboisPrade1990_FuzzyRough}, which are hybrid models combining graded membership with the boundary region uncertainty from indiscernibility inherent in rough set theory. Another approach is using soft sets \cite{Molodtsov1999_Soft}, giving rise to Fuzzy Soft Sets \cite{MajiBiswasRoy2001_FuzzySoft} where parameterized collections of objects are fuzzy sets rather than crisp ones. 


% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Type-2 Fuzzy Sets} \cite{Zadeh1975}: Membership grades are themselves fuzzy sets, modelling uncertainty \emph{about} the membership function itself. \textbf{Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets} is a common simplification where the secondary membership is an interval.
 
%     \item \textbf{Type-n Fuzzy Sets} \cite{Turksen1986_TypeNRelated}: Generalize Type-2 sets by defining membership as a fuzzy set of Type-($n-1$), primarily of theoretical interest.

%     \item \textbf{Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFS)} \cite{Atanassov1986}: Characterized by independent membership $\mu(x)$ and non-membership $\nu(x)$ degrees, constrained by $\mu(x) + \nu(x) \leq 1$. The remainder $1 - (\mu(x) + \nu(x))$ represents hesitation.

%     \item \textbf{Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IVIFS)} \cite{AtanassovGargov1989}: Extend IFS by representing both membership and non-membership degrees as intervals within $[0,1]$.

%     \item \textbf{Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFS)} \cite{Yager2013_Pythagorean}: Similar to IFS, but use a relaxed constraint $\mu(x)^2 + \nu(x)^2 \leq 1$. 

%     \item \textbf{q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (q-ROFS)} \cite{Yager2017_qRung}: Generalize IFS and PFS with the constraint $\mu(x)^q + \nu(x)^q \leq 1$ for $q \ge 1$.

%     \item \textbf{Spherical Fuzzy Sets (SFS)} \cite{GundogduKahraman2019_Spherical}: Extend orthopairs to three components: membership $\mu(x)$, non-membership $\nu(x)$, and indeterminacy $\pi(x)$, constrained by $\mu(x)^2 + \nu(x)^2 + \pi(x)^2 \leq 1$. They handle these aspects on a unit sphere.

%     \item \textbf{Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (HFS)} \cite{Torra2010}: Assign a set of several possible membership values in $[0,1]$ to an element. This directly models hesitation among different membership degrees.

%     \item \textbf{Bipolar Fuzzy Sets} \cite{Zhang1994_Bipolar}: Represent independent positive membership (satisfaction of a property) and negative membership (satisfaction of a counter-property). This models situations with bipolar or dichotomous information. \textbf{Bipolar Complex / Bipolar Spherical Fuzzy Sets} extend the bipolar concept using complex numbers or spherical orthopairs. This allows for richer representations in polarity-aware scenarios.

%     \item \textbf{Neutrosophic Sets (NS)} \cite{Smarandache1998_Neutrosophic, Wang2010_SVNS}: Defined by three independent components: Truth (T), Indeterminacy (I), and Falsity (F) memberships. Single-Valued Neutrosophic Sets (SVNS) constrain T, I, F to $[0,1]$.

%     \item \textbf{Picture Fuzzy Sets (PiFS)} \cite{Cuong2013_Picture}: Characterized by positive, neutral, and negative membership degrees, with their sum being $\leq 1$. These are suited for scenarios like voting with explicit ''yes, abstain, no" options.

%     \item \textbf{Rough Fuzzy Sets \& Fuzzy Rough Sets} \cite{DuboisPrade1990_FuzzyRough}: Hybrid models combining fuzzy sets and rough sets. They blend graded membership with boundary uncertainty from indiscernibility.

%     \item \textbf{Soft Sets} \cite{Molodtsov1999_Soft}: A parameterized family of crisp subsets, mapping parameters to subsets of a universe. An alternative tool for uncertainty dealing with parameterization.

%     \item \textbf{Fuzzy Soft Sets} \cite{MajiBiswasRoy2001_FuzzySoft}: Extend soft sets by allowing the parameterized subsets to be fuzzy sets rather than crisp ones. This combines parameterization with graded membership.

%     \item \textbf{Fuzzy Multisets}: Assign a multiset of membership counts or grades instead of a single grade. Useful when the frequency or repetition of membership observations is significant.

%     \item \textbf{L-Fuzzy Sets} \cite{Goguen1967}: Generalize Type-1 sets by taking membership grades from an arbitrary lattice L, not restricted to the interval $[0,1]$. This provides an order-theoretic abstraction.

%     \item \textbf{Complex Fuzzy Sets}: Membership grades are complex numbers, typically $r \cdot e^{i\theta}$. This encodes both magnitude (degree of membership) and phase (additional information).

%     \item \textbf{Quantum Fuzzy Sets} \cite{Pykacz2015_Quantum}: Interpret a quantum register's state-vector as the characteristic function of a fuzzy set. This applies principles from quantum mechanics to model membership.

%     \item \textbf{Plithogenic Sets} \cite{Smarandache2018_Plithogenic}: Generalize crisp, fuzzy, IFS, and NS by characterizing elements with multiple attributes. Each attribute value has an appurtenance degree and a contradiction degree.

%     \item \textbf{Hypersoft Sets} \cite{Smarandache2018_Hypersoft}: Extend soft sets to handle tuples or hierarchies of parameters (multi-argument approximate functions). This addresses multi-attribute decision-making.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Fuzzy Hypersoft Sets}: Combine fuzzy membership with the multi-parameter structures of hypersoft sets.
%         \item \textbf{Plithogenic Soft Sets \& Plithogenic Hypersoft Sets}: Merge Plithogenic fuzziness into soft set or hypersoft set parameterizations.
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item \textbf{Multipolar Fuzzy Sets (m-Polar Fuzzy Sets)} \cite{Chen2014_mPolar}: Generalize bipolar fuzzy sets to $m$ poles, assigning a vector of $m$ membership degrees from $[0,1]^m$. Models multi-polar evidence or criteria.

%     \item \textbf{k-Polar Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IKFS)}: Assign $k$ distinct pairs of intuitionistic membership/non-membership degrees to each element. Captures multi-source or multi-criteria hesitation.

%     \item \textbf{Multi-Neutrosophic Sets}: Evaluate truth, indeterminacy, and falsity through multiple sources, yielding n-tuples of (T,I,F) components.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Tripolar Neutrosophic Sets}: A specific type organizing truth, indeterminacy, and falsity along three distinct polar axes.
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item \textbf{Multi-Grade Fuzzy Sets}: Assign several membership grades (e.g., linguistic terms like ``low,'' ``medium,'' ``high'') from a structured, ordered scale. Captures more nuanced membership.
