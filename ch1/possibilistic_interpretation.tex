\signal{Possibility is normalized so that 1 membership is attained at some point. And it models the compatibility of 2 states. That is of being 1.80 height and being tall states.

Probability Models aleatoric uncertainty y Possibility models epistemic uncertainty?\\

Probability-Possibility Transformations:
Under certain conditions, one can associate a family of probability distributions with a given possibility distribution. For instance, the possibility distribution can be seen as an upper envelope for a set of probability measures that are consistent with the available imprecise information. Such transformations (e.g., the Dubois-Prade method) allow one to move between the two representations, albeit at the cost of introducing conservatism or ambiguity.\\


Bayesian Models for modeling both uncertainties:\\

Epistemic Uncertainty:

Bayesian models explicitly account for uncertainty about the model parameters by placing a prior over them and computing a posterior after observing data. This kind of uncertainty reflects our lack of knowledge due to limited data and can be reduced by gathering more information.\\

Aleatoric Uncertainty:

This type of uncertainty represents the inherent noise in the data itself (for example, measurement error). In Bayesian modeling, aleatoric uncertainty is often incorporated into the likelihood function. It is considered irreducible since it stems from the randomness in the data generation process.\\

Osea que a qué nos referimos con epistemologic uncertainty? A que nos falta info (data) o a que tenemos toda la info que se puede tener y no podemos reducir ese gap de incetidumbre porque es un problema de definición imprecisa. Tengo que diferenciar entre vagueza y epistemologico entonces?

From the paper: \cite{Dubois1993}: 
it is recalled in this paper that the probabilistic representations and the possibilisticones are not just two equivalent representations of uncertainty

The possibilisticrepresentation is weaker because it explicitly handles imprecision (e.g. incompleteknowledge) and because possibility measures are based on an \textbf{ordering structure} rather than an \textbf{additive one}.

the principle of insufficient reason from possibility toprobability, and the principle of maximum specificity from probability topossibility.
