\subsection{Union, Intersection and Complement of Fuzzy Sets}
\signal{say why we assign those properties to the union and intersection to generalize the ones from classical sets}
\begin{definition}[Triangular Norm]
    A mapping $T:[0,1]\times [0,1] \longrightarrow [0,1]$ that satisfies:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]\setlength{\itemindent}{2em}
      \item \textbf{Symmetricity:} $T(x,y) = T(y,x) \quad \oldforall x,y \in [0,1]$
      \item \textbf{Associativity:} $T(x,T(y,z)) = T(T(x,y),z) \quad \oldforall x,y,z \in [0,1]$
      \item \textbf{Monotonicity:} $T(x,y) \leq T(x',y') \quad \textnormal{if }x\leq x' \textnormal{ and } y\leq y' \quad \oldforall x,y,x',y' \in [0,1]$
      \item \textbf{One Identity:} $T(x,1) = T(1,x) = x \quad \oldforall x \in [0,1]$
    \end{enumerate}
    is called a triangular norm or t-norm. Defines the \textbf{intersection} of two fuzzy sets $A$ and $B$ on $X$ by giving the membership function as $(A \cup B) (x) = T(A(x),B(x)) \forall x \in X$ 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Triangular Conorm]
  A mapping $S:[0,1]\times [0,1] \longrightarrow [0,1]$ that satisfies:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]\setlength{\itemindent}{2em}
    \item \textbf{Symmetricity:} $S(x,y) = S(y,x) \quad \oldforall x,y \in [0,1]$
    \item \textbf{Associativity:} $S(x,T(y,z)) = S(S(x,y),z) \quad \oldforall x,y,z \in [0,1]$
    \item \textbf{Monotonicity:} $S(x,y) \leq S(x',y') \quad \textnormal{if }x\leq x' \textnormal{ and } y\leq y' \quad \oldforall x,y,x',y' \in [0,1]$
    \item \textbf{Zero Identity:} $S(x,0) = S(0,x) = x \quad \oldforall x \in [0,1]$
  \end{enumerate}
  is called a triangular conorm or t-conorm. Defines the \textbf{union} of two fuzzy sets $A$ and $B$ on $X$ by giving the membership function as $(A \cap  B) (x) = S(A(x),B(x)) \forall x \in X$ 
    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Complement]
    The complement of a fuzzy set $A$ is another fuzzy set with membership function given by $^\lnot A(x) \coleq 1 - A(x)$
\end{definition}

Notice that this definition of complement is consistent with the classical definition of complement but implies that an element might have \textbf{non-zero partial membership} to both a fuzzy set and its complement: Let $A$ be a fuzzy set on $X$ and $x \in X / A(x)\notin \{0,1\}$ then $\lnot A(x)= 1 - A(x) \notin \{0,1\}$.\\

This implies as well that the union of a fuzzy set and its complement is not the total set in general. Analogously, the intersection will not the empty set in general. Those two properties that hold in classical sets, are often called the \textbf{laws of excluded middle and of non-contradiction}, respectively.\\

However, there is a particular t-norm and t-conorm (named after Lukasiewicz) that does satisfy both laws. This will have implications for the derived logic that will be explained in section \ref{sec:fuzzy_logic}. \signal{is it the only one?}

\hspace{10em}$T_L(x,y)=\max\{x+y-1,0\},\, S_L(x,y)=\min\{1,x+y\}$\\

Another important property that classical union and intersection satisfy is De Morgan's Laws. For an arbitrary pair of t-norm and t-conorm they are not satisfied but by imposing it, we get that the t-norm induces a t-conorm and viceversa.

\begin{proposition}[Relationship between t-norm and t-conorm]
  Given a t-norm $T$, the t-conorm $S(a,b)\coleq 1 - T(1-a, 1-b)$, then the union and intersection defined by that pair satisfy the De Morgan's Laws.
\end{proposition}
\begin{remark}
  It is easy to see that the previous relation is equivalent to $T(a,b) = 1-S(1-a, 1-b)$ which can be obtained simply by substituting $a'=1-a$ and $b'=1-b$, i.e., working with the complementary fuzzy sets.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x\in X$, $A$, $B$ be fuzzy sets over $X$ with $a \coleq A(x)$ and $b \coleq B(x)$\\

  $\quad \boxed{\text{not}(A \text{ or } B) = (\text{not } A) \text{ and } (\text{not } B)}$\\
  $$\lnot S(a,b) = T(\lnot a, \lnot b)$$
  $$1 - S(a,b) = T(1-a, 1-b)$$
  $$S(a,b) = 1 - T(1-a, 1-b)$$
  $\quad \boxed{\text{not}(A \text{ and } B) = (\text{not } A) \text{ or } (\text{not } B)}$\\
  $$\lnot T(a,b) = S(\lnot a, \lnot b)$$
  $$1 - T(a,b) = S(1-a, 1-b)$$
  $$T(a,b) = 1 - S(1-a, 1-b)$$

\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Archimedean t-norm]
  A continuous t-norm that satisfies $T(x,x)<x \forall x\in ]0,1[$ is called an archimedean t-norm.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Characterization of archimedean t-norms]
  For all archimedean t-norms there exists a continuous decreasing function $f:[0,1] \longrightarrow [0,\infty[$ with $f(1)=0$ such that: 
  \[ 
  T(x,y)= f^{-1}(\min\{f(x)+f(y), f(0)\}) \text{ where } f^{-1} =
  \begin{cases}
    f^{-1}(y) & \text{if } y\in [0,f(0) ]\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}

\begin{definition}[Weaker t-norm]
  Given $T_1, T_2$ t-norms, then $T_1$ is weaker than $T_2$ $(T_1 \leq T_2)$ if $T_1(x,y)\leq T_2(x,y)\forall x,y\in [0,1]$.\\
  In that case, it is equivalent to say $T_2$ is stronger than $T_1$ $(T_2 \geq T_1)$

\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  This defines a partial order relation in the set of t-norms.
\end{remark}
\signal{The weaker the t-norm, the stronger the associated s-norm? (not proved in Fuller)}

\signal{
There are many results like all t-norms are between the weak and the min, all t-conorms are between max and strong, or that min is the only t-norm that satisfies $T(a,a)=a$ (igual es por esto ultimo q se usa tanto. Qué implicaciones tiene que lukasiewicz no cumpla eso?)}

\subsection{Fuzzy Relations}
\signal{Igual esto motivar la definición de relación con un ejemplo a estas alturas es pasarse?}

In the previous sections we have been working with a single domain denoted by $X$. Intuitively, it might be useful to think about the domain as the possible values of property independently of the object that has those properties. For example, we could say that for the property lenght the domain is $\R^+\coleq
\{x\in\R \min x \geq 0\}$ and a person might have a height defined in that domain (modeled as a subset), although not all possible lengths values will be part of the support of a person's height since it is save to assume impossible to be 10 meters tall. If we were to look at the arm length, then we would have another subset of the lenghts. Treating each subset independently, doesn't allow to distinguish between the people of the same height with different arm lenght or viceversa. Therefore it is needed to distinguish each unique combination of attributes. Notice that in this example, height and arm length have the same domain but for example hair color would have a different domain.\\

Mathematically, this is done taking the subsets of the cartesian product of the domains, so that each element is a unique possible combination of attributes, an ordered n-tuple over that domain. For simplicity, let us consider just the cartesian product of 2 sets. \signal{(The general case can be obtained inductively)}. Again, the "fuzzy" part will be referred to how we generalize the membership values to the continuum.\\

To justify the definition of the membership function of a cartesian product of two fuzzy sets, let us first recall that in classical sets, we can retrieve the orginal subsets individually by taking the projection of the cartesian product. Given $R$ a relation on $X\times Y$ the projections are:

\[\Pi_X(R)=\{x \in X \mid \exists y \in Y \textnormal{ such that } (x,y) \in R\}\]
\[\Pi_Y(R)=\{y \in Y \mid \exists x \in X \textnormal{ such that } (x,y) \in R\}\]

Then, with the boolean membership, can be defined as:

\[\Pi_X(R)(x)=\sup\{R(x,y) \mid y\in Y\}=
\begin{cases}
  1 & \textnormal{if } \exists y \in Y \textnormal{ such that } (x,y) \in R \\
  0 & \textnormal{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
\[
  \Pi_Y(R)(y)=\sup\{R(x,y) \mid x\in X\}=
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \textnormal{if } \exists x \in X \textnormal{ such that } (x,y) \in R \\
    0 & \textnormal{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\]

It is clear that in the case of having 2 possible values for the membership function, the above expresions are identical. The use of $\sup$ in the definition of the projection can be intuitively interpreted as the \textit{shadow} of the membership function of the cartesian product, as figure \ref{fig:class_cart_prod} illustrates. It is also desirable because then the following property holds for any classical cartesian product:\\
$$ 
\Pi_X(A\times B)=A \quad \textnormal{ and } \quad \Pi_Y(A\times B)=B \forall A\in X, \forall B \in Y
$$

Generalizing the definition of projection with the supremum to fuzzy sets, we have a way to retrieve the membership function of each fuzzy set given the membership function fuzzy cartesian product (figure \ref{fig:fuzzy_cart_prod}). So we now want a consistent definition of cartesian product that respects the previous property.\\

For a given point in $A\times B$ we have 2 values of membership: $A(x)$ and $B(y)$ \signal{Justify that in the classical part we took the intersection. }
