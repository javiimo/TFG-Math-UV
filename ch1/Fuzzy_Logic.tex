Considering partial memberships and working with fuzzy sets has many implications for the logical framework that is derived from it. The field is vast and is best understood from the perspective of algebraic logic (see appendix \ref{app:alg_log}). However, this section only aims to very briefly introduce without proof some of the main results and concepts related to fuzzy logics: fuzzy implications, different fuzzy logics derived from t-norms and approximate reasoning.\\

In classical propositional logic\footnote{See appendix \ref{app:form_log} for a brief introduction to the concepts of formal logic}, there is a very straightforward relation between set-membership and truth values. It is the same to state \say{$x$ belongs to $A$} or \say{(it is true that) $x$ is $A$}. This direct correspondence extends to the fundamental operations of sets and logical connectives: stating that \say{$x$ belongs to the intersection of $A$ and $B$} (denoted $x \in A \cap B$) is equivalent to asserting that \say{$x$ is $A$ AND $x$ is $B$} (the logical conjunction $P_A(x) \land P_B(x)$ is true). The case for union $\cup$ and disjunction $\lor$ is analogous. Finally, the concept of an element $x$ belonging to the negation of set $A$ ($x \in \overline{A}$), meaning $x$ does not belong to $A$, directly mirrors logical negation ($\neg$). When working with fuzzy sets, we consider partial truth (degrees of truth as degrees of membership).\\

The implication connective is rooted in the residuation (or adjointness) property, which views implication $I$ ($A \Rightarrow B$, or "if $A$, then $B$") as a form of logical division: $A \land I \models B$ in logic (or $A \cap I \subseteq B$ in set theory). The goal is to find the weakest proposition (or largest set)\footnote{Intersection with a larger set $I$ is less restrictive respect to inclusion of sets. If intersection with the largest set is contained, intersection with any smaller set will also be contained.} $I$ such that combining $A$ with $I$ through conjunction (intersection) yields something at least as strong as (contained in) $B$. This largest $I$ satisfying the condition defines the implication $A \Rightarrow B$, internalizing the notion of logical consequence. Logical equivalence ($A \iff B$, or "$A$ if and only if $B$") occurs when both $A \Rightarrow B$ and $B \Rightarrow A$ hold. In set theory, this corresponds to mutual subset relations ($A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$), which can only be true when sets $A$ and $B$ are identical. Thus, logical equivalence between propositions directly corresponds to set equality.





The transition from classical to fuzzy sets requires extending the notion of truth from binary to graded values. This involves generalizing logical connectives while preserving their essential properties and meaning in the continuous domain.
\signal{THE FIGURES DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CLASSICAL As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:syntax_diagram}, fuzzy propositional logic syntax builds upon classical propositional variables and connectives, potentially adding truth constants. For fuzzy predicate logic, this is further extended with object symbols (variables, constants), structure symbols (predicates, functions), and quantifiers. Semantically (Figure~\ref{fig:semantics_diagram}), propositional fuzzy logic requires a truth value algebra (e.g., $[0,1]$ with t-norms and residua) and evaluation functions. Predicate logic then incorporates a domain of discourse, interpretations of constants, functions, and crucially, predicates as fuzzy relations mapping to this truth value algebra.}\\

The task of defining connectives for truth values in the continuous interval $[0,1]$ requires creating a framework that is both intuitively meaningful and mathematically sound. The development of many valued propositional calculi follows several key principles \cite[p.27]{Hajek1998}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We primarily deal with \textbf{propositional logic} as the foundation.
    \item The set of truth values is the real unit interval $[0,1]$, where $1$ represents absolute truth and $0$ absolute falsity. The natural linear ordering of reals plays a crucial role.
    \item The logic is \textbf{truth-functional}: each $k$-ary logical connective $c$ is associated with a truth function $f_c: [0,1]^k \to [0,1]$. The truth degree of a compound formula $c(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k)$ is determined solely by the truth degrees of its constituent formulas $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k$.
    \item Fuzzy logic must be a \textbf{generalization of classical two-valued logic}. This means that for truth values restricted to $\{0,1\}$, the fuzzy connectives must behave identically to their classical counterparts.
\end{enumerate}
With these principles, we can start constructing the connectives.

\paragraph{Conjunction, Disjunction, and Negation}\signal{Esto lo puedo acortar yo creo}In classical logic, conjunction corresponds to set intersection. When generalizing to fuzzy sets, the truth function for conjunction should capture the intuition that \say{a large truth degree of $\phi \text{ \& } \psi$ should indicate that both the truth degree of $\phi$ and the truth degree of $\psi$ is large}\cite[p.27]{Hajek1998}. This leads to the adoption of \textbf{t-norms} (triangular norms) as the truth functions for fuzzy conjunction. The three basic continuous t-norms (\luka, Gödel/minimum, and Product) are particularly important as they give rise to three fundamental fuzzy logics: Lukasiewicz logic ($\L$), Gödel logic ($G$) and Product logic ($\Pi$), respectively. \signal{MENCIONAR QUÉ AXIOMAS SON ESOS QUE LOS HACEN ESPECIALES Y SI EL HECHO DE QUE ESAS T-NORMAS GENEREN TODAS LAS NORMAS CONTINUAS, TIENE ALGUNA IMPLICACIÓN. Each of these logics is characterized by specific axioms that reflect the algebraic properties of its underlying t-norm, making them cornerstones in the study of fuzzy logical systems.}

Fuzzy \textbf{disjunction (OR)} and fuzzy \textbf{negation (NOT)} are generalized from their classical set-theoretic counterparts (union and complement, respectively) and are typically defined using t-conorms and fuzzy complement functions, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:set_operations}.

\subsection{Fuzzy Implications}

\signal{Falta entender bien el concepto de implicación material. Lo que se entiende por implicación material (propiedad del residuo) y lo que no y qué repercusiones tiene eso para la lógica.}

The implication connective ($P \rightarrow Q$, "IF $P$ THEN $Q$") is arguably the most critical for logical reasoning and building rule-based systems, such as those used to model expert opinion in MCDM, a topic that will be explored further in the next chapter. Its generalization to fuzzy logic presents a rich variety of approaches. A fuzzy implication $I(x,y)$ (where $x$ is the truth value of the antecedent and $y$ that of the consequent) aims to quantify "to what extent $q$ is at least as true as $p$" (\cite[p.57]{FULLER2}). Different formalizations capture this intuition in different ways. The choice among them depends heavily on the specific application and the desired properties.

\paragraph{R-Implications (Residuated Implications)}
This class of implications arises directly from the residuation principle you introduced earlier and is fundamental in algebraic fuzzy logic. Given a t-norm $T$ (representing conjunction), its corresponding R-implication $I_R$ is defined as the residuum of $T$:
\[I_R(x,y) = \sup \{z \in [0,1] \mid T(x,z) \le y\}\]
This definition ensures that $I_R(x,y)$ is the weakest (largest) truth value $z$ such that when $x$ is conjoined with $z$ (using $T$), the result is no stronger (no greater) than $y$ (\cite[Def. 2.1.5, p.29]{Hajek1998}). This property is crucial for the soundness of modus ponens in fuzzy logic. \signal{Esto se puede extendar a left semicont.}
\begin{example}[R-Implications from Continuous T-norms \cite{Hajek1998}]
The main continuous t-norms yield the following R-implications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Łukasiewicz Implication} (from $T_L(x,y) = \max(0, x+y-1)$):
    \[I_L(x,y) = \min(1, 1-x+y)\]
    \item The \textbf{Gödel Implication} (from $T_G(x,y) = \min(x,y)$):
    \[I_G(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \le y \\ y & \text{if } x > y \end{cases}\]
    \item The \textbf{Goguen (or Product) Implication} (from $T_P(x,y) = xy$):
    \[I_P(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \le y \\ y/x & \text{if } x > y \end{cases}\]
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
R-implications are vital for constructing axiomatic fuzzy logical systems because they possess strong algebraic properties that ensure logical coherence. \signal{Explicar esto más.}

\paragraph{S-Implications (Standard Implications)}
This family of implications is derived from the classical logical equivalence $P \rightarrow Q \equiv \neg P \lor Q$. A fuzzy S-implication is defined using a fuzzy negation and a t-conorm $S$ \cite[p.59]{FULLER2}:
\[I_S(x,y) = S(\overline{x}, y)\]
\begin{example}[S-Implications]
Common examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Kleene-Dienes Implication}, using standard negation $\overline{x}=1-x$ and maximum t-conorm $S(a,b)=\max(a,b)$:
    \[I_{KD}(x,y) = \max(1-x, y)\]
    \item If the Łukasiewicz t-conorm $S_L(a,b) = \min(1, a+b)$ is used with standard negation, the resulting S-implication is $I_L(x,y) = \min(1, 1-x+y)$, which is identical to the Łukasiewicz R-implication.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\paragraph{Implications from T-norms (for Fuzzy Rules)}
In many practical applications, especially in fuzzy control and Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) fuzzy systems used in MCDM, implications are defined directly using a t-norm:
\[I(x,y) = T(x,y)\]
\begin{example}[T-norm based Implications \cite{FULLER2}]
Popular examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Mamdani Implication}: $I_M(x,y) = \min(x,y)$ (using the Gödel t-norm).
    \item The \textbf{Larsen Implication}: $I_{La}(x,y) = xy$ (using the Product t-norm).
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
It is crucial to recognize that, as \cite[p.60]{FULLER2} notes, ``these implications do not verify the properties of material implication'' in all respects. For instance, with the Mamdani implication, $I_M(0,0) = \min(0,0) = 0$, whereas classical and most other fuzzy implications yield $I(0,0)=1$. However, in the context of fuzzy rule-based systems, if an antecedent is false (truth value 0), the rule often contributes nothing to the output, making this behavior desirable.

\paragraph{Standard Strict Implication}
The most direct generalization of the classical idea that $P \rightarrow Q$ is true if and only if the truth value of $P$ is less than or equal to the truth value of $Q$ is the \textbf{Standard Strict Implication} (\cite[p.58]{FULLER2}):
\[I_{SS}(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \le y \\ 0 & \text{if } x > y \end{cases}\]
While intuitive, this implication is highly sensitive to small changes in input values (e.g., $I_{SS}(0.8, 0.8)=1$ but $I_{SS}(0.8, 0.7999)=0$), making it less suitable for applications dealing with imprecise numerical data \cite[p.58]{FULLER2}.

The Lukasiewicz t-conorm is closely related to the basic binary operation of multi-valued
algebras. Additionally, t-norms and t-conorms form examples of aggregation operators. They
play a significant role in the axiomatic definition of the concept of triangular norm-based measure
and, in particular, of the concept of probability of fuzzy events; the Frank family of t-norms and
t-conorms plays a particular role [6].

It should be mentioned that t-norms overlap with copulas [3, 24]: commutative associative
copulas are t-norms; t-norms which satisfy the 1-Lipschitz condition are copulas. Some families
of t-norms are known as families of copulas under different names}

    Gödel Logic uses 
    $a \otimes b = \min(a, b)$, which tends to produce conservative scores dominated by the weakest criterion. While useful for risk-averse scenarios, it fails to differentiate alternatives when all criteria are partially satisfied.

    Product Logic employs 
    $a \otimes b = a \cdot b$, amplifying the impact of low-scoring criteria. This can lead to premature elimination of alternatives with one poor attribute.

    Łukasiewicz Logic's additive t-norm balances compensation between criteria, allowing alternatives to offset weaknesses in one dimension with strengths in others—a critical feature for complex trade-off analysis.

\subsection{Approximate Reasoning and Pavelka-Style Completeness}

Classical deductive systems typically deal with absolute truth: premises are assumed to be fully true (truth value 1), and sound inference rules guarantee that conclusions are also fully true. However, in many real-world scenarios and in the spirit of fuzzy logic, we often reason with information that is only partially true or true to a certain degree. This leads to the field of **approximate reasoning**, where we are interested in the degree to which a conclusion follows from premises that themselves have degrees of truth.

A significant contribution to formalizing reasoning with degrees of truth was made by Jan Pavelka in the 1970s, particularly for logics related to Łukasiewicz logic. His work was later refined and integrated into the broader t-norm based framework by Hájek. The core idea is to extend a fuzzy logical system (like Łukasiewicz logic, denoted L) with rational truth constants $\bar{r}$ for every rational $r \in [0,1] \cap \mathbb{Q}$. A formula $(\bar{r} \rightarrow \phi)$ can then be interpreted as stating "$\phi$ is true to a degree at least $r$".

This framework allows for the definition of two key concepts for a given theory $T$ (a set of axioms, each potentially associated with a truth degree or assumed to be fully true):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Truth Degree of $\phi$ over $T$}: $||\phi||_T = \inf\{e(\phi) \mid e \text{ is a model of } T\}$. This is the lowest degree to which $\phi$ is true in all models that satisfy the theory $T$.
    \item \textbf{Provability Degree of $\phi$ over $T$}: $|\phi|_T = \sup\{r \mid T \vdash (\bar{r} \rightarrow \phi)\}$. This is the highest degree $r$ such that it is provable from $T$ that $\phi$ is true to degree at least $r$.
\end{itemize}

Pavelka's completeness theorem for Rational Pavelka Logic (RPL), which is Łukasiewicz logic extended with rational truth-value constants and appropriate "bookkeeping" axioms for these constants, establishes a fundamental connection between these semantic and syntactic degrees.

\begin{theorem}[Pavelka-style Completeness for RPL]
For any theory $T$ in Rational Pavelka Logic and any formula $\phi$:
\[ |\phi|_T = ||\phi||_T \]
\end{theorem}

This remarkable result states that the highest degree to which a formula is provable from a theory $T$ is precisely the lowest degree to which it is true in all models of $T$. It provides a formal calculus for "approximate reasoning" where conclusions can be derived with associated degrees of truth based on the degrees of truth of the premises. For instance, if we have premises $A_1, \dots, A_k$ with associated truth degrees $r_1, \dots, r_k$, and we can syntactically derive a conclusion $C$ with an associated provability degree $s$ that depends on $r_1, \dots, r_k$, Pavelka's theorem ensures that this syntactically derived degree $s$ is the "best possible" semantic guarantee for the truth of $C$. While the original RPL is specific to Łukasiewicz logic due to its reliance on the properties of the Łukasiewicz t-norm and its residuum, the general concept of graded provability and its relation to graded truth is a cornerstone of advanced fuzzy logic.
