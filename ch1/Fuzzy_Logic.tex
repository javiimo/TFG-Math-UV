\signal{$(\fuzzy{X},\cup , \cap , \lnot)$ is a complete, completely distributive, lattice with an involution. This extends the boolean algebra.}

The Lukasiewicz t-conorm is closely related to the basic binary operation of multi-valued
algebras. Additionally, t-norms and t-conorms form examples of aggregation operators. They
play a significant role in the axiomatic definition of the concept of triangular norm-based measure
and, in particular, of the concept of probability of fuzzy events; the Frank family of t-norms and
t-conorms plays a particular role [6].

It should be mentioned that t-norms overlap with copulas [3, 24]: commutative associative
copulas are t-norms; t-norms which satisfy the 1-Lipschitz condition are copulas. Some families
of t-norms are known as families of copulas under different names}

    Lukasiewicz logic algebraic structure and formal implications thanks to the residual property.\\

    Gödel Logic uses 
    $a \otimes b = \min(a, b)$, which tends to produce conservative scores dominated by the weakest criterion. While useful for risk-averse scenarios, it fails to differentiate alternatives when all criteria are partially satisfied.

    Product Logic employs 
    $a \otimes b = a \cdot b$, amplifying the impact of low-scoring criteria. This can lead to premature elimination of alternatives with one poor attribute.

    Łukasiewicz Logic's additive t-norm balances compensation between criteria, allowing alternatives to offset weaknesses in one dimension with strengths in others—a critical feature for complex trade-off analysis.
