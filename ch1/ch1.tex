\chapter{Fuzzy Set Theory}
\label{ch:FStheory}
This chapter builds upon foundational concepts and theoretical frameworks presented in \cite{FULLER1} and \cite{FULLER2}. A self-contained introduction to Fuzzy Set Theory is provided, establishing the mathematical foundations required for its application in multi criteria decision making, as explored in subsequent chapters. The development follows a structured progression from fundamental concepts to more complex applications. Starting with the core definition of a fuzzy set, the generalization of intersection, union and complement operations is presented. This framework is then extended to model more complex relationships via fuzzy relations and specialized for quantitative reasoning through the introduction of fuzzy numbers. To situate this theory within the broader landscape of uncertainty presented in Chapter 1, probability and possibility measures are discussed. The chapter concludes with a brief examination of the implications of partial truths in (fuzzy) logic, derived from the set theoretic operations, and acknowledges the limitations and alternatives to fuzzy sets proposed in the literature.
