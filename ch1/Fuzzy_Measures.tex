Probability Models aleatoric uncertainty y Possibility models epistemic uncertainty?\\

Probability-Possibility Transformations:
Under certain conditions, one can associate a family of probability distributions with a given possibility distribution. For instance, the possibility distribution can be seen as an upper envelope for a set of probability measures that are consistent with the available imprecise information. Such transformations (e.g., the Dubois-Prade method) allow one to move between the two representations, albeit at the cost of introducing conservatism or ambiguity.\\


Bayesian Models for modeling both uncertainties:\\

Epistemic Uncertainty:

Bayesian models explicitly account for uncertainty about the model parameters by placing a prior over them and computing a posterior after observing data. This kind of uncertainty reflects our lack of knowledge due to limited data and can be reduced by gathering more information.\\

Aleatoric Uncertainty:

This type of uncertainty represents the inherent noise in the data itself (for example, measurement error). In Bayesian modeling, aleatoric uncertainty is often incorporated into the likelihood function. It is considered irreducible since it stems from the randomness in the data generation process.\\

Osea que a qué nos referimos con epistemologic uncertainty? A que nos falta info (data) o a que tenemos toda la info que se puede tener y no podemos reducir ese gap de incetidumbre porque es un problema de definición imprecisa. Tengo que diferenciar entre vagueza y epistemologico entonces?

From the paper: \cite{Dubois1993}: 
it is recalled in this paper that the probabilistic representations and the possibilisticones are not just two equivalent representations of uncertainty

The possibilisticrepresentation is weaker because it explicitly handles imprecision (e.g. incompleteknowledge) and because possibility measures are based on an \textbf{ordering structure} rather than an \textbf{additive one}.

Classical measure theory, particularly probability theory, relies heavily on the principle of additivity. This principle dictates how the measure of a union of disjoint sets relates to the measures of the individual sets. While powerful, this additivity can be restrictive in scenarios where interactions, redundancies, or synergies between elements are significant.

\begin{definition}[Fuzzy Measure (Capacity)]
Let $\Omega$ be a universal set. A \textbf{fuzzy measure} (or capacity) $\mu$ is a set function
\[ \mu: \powerset{\Omega} \to [0, 1] \]
that assigns a value to each subset of $\Omega$ (often called an event or criterion) such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Boundary Conditions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$ (the measure of the empty set is zero).
        \item $\mu(\Omega) = 1$ (the measure of the universal set is one).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monotonicity:} For any $A, B \subseteq \Omega$, if $A \subseteq B$, then $\mu(A) \le \mu(B)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The crucial departure from classical probability (in its general form) is the absence of a strict additivity requirement for disjoint sets. This allows fuzzy measures to model situations where, for example, the combined importance of two criteria $A$ and $B$ might be greater than the sum of their individual importances (synergy) or less (redundancy). The value $\mu(A)$ quantifies the weight, importance, degree of belief, or capacity associated with the subset $A$.

\subsection{Representations of Fuzzy Measures}
A fuzzy measure $\mu$ is fundamentally defined by its $2^{|\Omega|}$ values assigned to all subsets of $\Omega$. This is its standard representation. However, alternative representations exist that can be more convenient for certain analyses or computations.
\begin{definition}[Möbius Transform]
For a fuzzy measure $\mu$ on a finite set $\Omega$, its \textbf{Möbius transform} $m: \powerset{\Omega} \to \mathbb{R}$ is another set function defined as:
\[ m(A) = \sum_{B \subseteq A} (-1)^{|A \setminus B|} \mu(B), \quad \forall A \subseteq \Omega \]
Conversely, the fuzzy measure can be recovered from its Möbius transform:
\[ \mu(A) = \sum_{B \subseteq A} m(B), \quad \forall A \subseteq \Omega \]
\end{definition}
The Möbius transform provides an alternative way to characterize the fuzzy measure and is particularly useful in analyzing interactions between elements, a topic explored when considering how these measures are used in aggregation processes. For very small universal sets, a Hasse diagram can visually represent the fuzzy measure values for all subsets.

\subsection{Types of Fuzzy Measures}
The general definition of a fuzzy measure is quite broad. Within this framework, numerous specific types of fuzzy measures have been defined to capture different kinds of uncertainty, non-additivity, or interaction patterns. Two of the most prominent are probability measures and possibility measures, which will be the focus of the next section. Other types, such as belief measures or $\lambda$-measures, also exist and offer different ways to model non-additive information. The choice of fuzzy measure type is crucial when these measures are employed in more complex frameworks, such as for aggregation or integration, which are important applications discussed in subsequent chapters.

Fuzzy measures are classified based on several criteria. These include restrictions on their output values (e.g., 0-1 or Boolean measures), their behavior concerning additivity (additive, subadditive, superadditive) and modularity (submodular, supermodular, modular), which describe interactions between set contributions. Symmetry, where the measure depends only on set cardinality, is another criterion. Decomposability defines how the measure of a union of disjoint sets is derived from the measures of its components, with $\lambda$-fuzzy measures and possibility measures being key examples. Measures can also be classified by their duality properties, their relationship to $k$-monotonicity or $k$-alternativity (leading to belief and plausibility measures), or by their construction method, such as distorted probability measures.

\subsection*{Special Mention: Probability and Possibility}

Within this classification framework:

\textbf{Probability measures} are a cornerstone. They are defined as \textit{additive fuzzy measures} (Definition 2.4), meaning $\mu(A \cup B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B)$ for disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, and $\mu(N)=1$. Due to their additivity, they are also \textit{modular} (Note 2.6), \textit{self-dual} (Note 2.1 implies this as additive measures are self-dual), and simultaneously \textit{belief measures} and \textit{plausibility measures} (Note 2.17). They are also decomposable with respect to the Łukasiewicz t-conorm (Note 2.25).

\textbf{Possibility measures} (Pos) are characterized by the property $\text{Pos}(A \cup B) = \max\{\text{Pos}(A), \text{Pos}(B)\}$ (Definition 2.14). This makes them a specific type of \textit{decomposable fuzzy measure} (Note 2.26, using the maximum t-conorm). They are inherently \textit{subadditive} (page 7, bottom paragraph) and are a type of \textit{plausibility measure} (Note 2.18). Their duals are \textit{necessity measures}, which are a type of \textit{belief measure}.

\section{Probability and Possibility Measures}
Probability and possibility measures are two distinct yet related formalisms for quantifying uncertainty, both falling under the umbrella of fuzzy measures.

\begin{definition}[Probability Measure]
A \textbf{probability measure} $P$ is a fuzzy measure that additionally satisfies the axiom of \textbf{finite additivity} for disjoint sets:
For any two disjoint sets $A, B \subseteq \Omega$ (i.e., $A \cap B = \emptyset$):
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \]
\end{definition}
A probability measure quantifies the likelihood or frequency of an event occurring, or the degree of belief that a proposition is true. The sum of probabilities for a complete set of mutually exclusive elementary events is 1.

\begin{definition}[Possibility Measure]
A \textbf{possibility measure} $\Pi$, pioneered by Zadeh \cite{Zadeh1978}, is a fuzzy measure characterized by the axiom of \textbf{maxitivity} (or sup-additivity):
For any two sets $A, B \subseteq \Omega$:
\[ \Pi(A \cup B) = \max(\Pi(A), \Pi(B)) \]
\end{definition}
A possibility measure quantifies the degree to which an event is considered possible, plausible, or compatible with available knowledge. It is often derived from a \textbf{possibility distribution} $\pi: \Omega \to [0, 1]$, where $\pi(x)$ is the possibility that a variable takes the value $x$. Then, for any $A \subseteq \Omega$, $\Pi(A) = \sup_{x \in A} \pi(x)$. Normalization typically requires $\sup_{x \in \Omega} \pi(x) = 1$, which implies $\Pi(\Omega) = 1$.

\subsection{Conceptual Differences: An Example}
Consider a standard six-sided die.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probability:} If the die is fair, the probability of rolling any specific number $x \in \{1, ..., 6\}$ is $P(\{x\}) = 1/6$.
    The probability of rolling an even number is $P(\text{even}) = P(\{2\}) + P(\{4\}) + P(\{6\}) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2$.
    Similarly, $P(\text{odd}) = 1/2$. Note that $P(\text{even}) + P(\text{odd}) = 1$.
    Also, $P(\text{even} \cup \text{odd}) = P(\Omega) = 1$.

    \item \textbf{Possibility:} If our knowledge only states that "it is possible to roll any number from 1 to 6," we might assign a possibility distribution $\pi(x) = 1$ for all $x \in \{1, ..., 6\}$.
    Then, the possibility of rolling an even number is $\Pi(\text{even}) = \max(\pi(2), \pi(4), \pi(6)) = \max(1,1,1) = 1$.
    Similarly, $\Pi(\text{odd}) = \max(\pi(1), \pi(3), \pi(5)) = 1$.
    Here, $\Pi(\text{even}) = 1$ means "it is fully possible to roll an even number." It does not mean it is certain.
    Crucially, it is not required that $\Pi(A) + \Pi(\overline{A}) = 1$. In this example, $\Pi(\text{even}) = 1$ and $\Pi(\overline{\text{even}}) = \Pi(\text{odd}) = 1$. This reflects a state of incomplete information: it's fully possible to be even, and fully possible to be odd.
    Also, $\Pi(\text{even} \cup \text{odd}) = \max(\Pi(\text{even}), \Pi(\text{odd})) = \max(1,1) = 1$.
\end{itemize}
Associated with every possibility measure is a dual \textbf{necessity measure} $N$, defined as $N(A) = 1 - \Pi(\overline{A})$. $N(A)$ quantifies the degree to which event $A$ is certainly true or necessarily implied. For our dice example, $N(\text{even}) = 1 - \Pi(\text{odd}) = 1 - 1 = 0$. It is not necessary to roll an even number.

\subsection{Probability-Possibility Transformations}
Despite their distinct conceptual foundations, probability and possibility measures are not entirely disconnected. The relationship $N(A) \le P(A) \le \Pi(A)$ suggests an ordering and provides a basis for transformations.

\subsubsection{Rationale and Core Assumption}
Transformations between these measures are often sought for practical reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We might have probabilistic information but need a possibilistic model for certain types of reasoning (e.g., reasoning about feasibility under uncertainty).
    \item We might have possibilistic information (e.g., from expert elicitation of what's feasible) but need a probability distribution for decision-making processes that require expected utility calculations.
\end{itemize}
The core assumption underlying many transformations is that \textbf{possibility acts as an upper bound for probability}: $P(A) \le \Pi(A)$ for all $A \subseteq \Omega$. This implies that what is probable must first be possible. An event cannot be likely if it's not even deemed possible to some corresponding degree. The set of all probability measures $P$ consistent with a given possibility measure $\Pi$ is called a credal set.

\subsubsection{Transformations from Probability to Possibility (P$\to\Pi$)}
The goal here is to summarize or bound a precise probability distribution $p$ (defined on elementary events) with a possibility distribution $\pi$ (which induces $\Pi$) such that $p(x) \le \pi(x)$ for all $x \in \Omega$, and often, to preserve the ranking of probabilities.
One common method, attributed to Dubois and Prade \cite{DuboisPrade1983}, is the \textbf{least-specific dominating possibility distribution}.
Given a probability distribution $p=(p_1, \dots, p_n)$ over a finite universe $\Omega = \{\omega_1, \dots, \omega_n\}$, with elements ordered such that $p_1 \ge p_2 \ge \dots \ge p_n$ (where $p_k$ is the probability of $\omega_k$). The possibility degree for $\omega_k$ is defined based on cumulative probabilities:
\[ \pi(\omega_k) = \sum_{i=k}^{n} p_i \]
This is typically normalized so that $\max_k \pi(\omega_k) = \pi(\omega_1) = 1$.
\textbf{Intuition:} The most probable element is fully possible. The possibility of less probable elements reflects the cumulative probability of them and all elements less probable than them. This ensures the order-preserving property and consistency with $P(A) \le \Pi(A)$. Such transformations inherently involve a loss of information, as the additivity of probability is replaced by the weaker maxitivity of possibility.

\subsubsection{Transformations from Possibility to Probability ($\Pi\to$P)}
The goal is to select a single probability distribution $p$ from the credal set $\mathcal{P}(\Pi)$ defined by a possibility distribution $\pi$. This often involves an "information filling-in" step, guided by principles like maximum entropy or insufficient reason.
A well-known example is the \textbf{pignistic transform} (context of belief functions, of which possibility measures are a special case). For a consonant belief structure (like possibility), given distinct possibility levels $1 = \alpha_0 > \alpha_1 > \dots > \alpha_m = 0$, we define $\alpha$-cuts $E_j = \{\omega : \pi(\omega) \ge \alpha_j\}$. The probability mass $(\alpha_{j-1} - \alpha_j)$ that "drops" between two successive possibility levels is distributed uniformly among the elements in the narrower (more possible) set $E_{j-1}$:
\[ p(\omega) = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{\alpha_{j-1} - \alpha_j}{|E_{j-1}|} \mathbf{1}_{\{\omega \in E_{j-1}\}} \]
\textbf{Intuition:} Elements that are equally highly possible share the available probability mass assigned to that level of possibility. This transform selects the probability distribution that is maximally non-committal (maximizes entropy) within the constraints imposed by the possibility measure. These transformations add assumptions to select one specific probability distribution from many consistent ones.

\subsubsection{Limitations and Assumptions of Transformations}
It is crucial to understand that transformations are not universally applicable without careful consideration of their underlying assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The $P(A) \le \Pi(A)$ Postulate:} This is a fundamental modeling choice, not an inherent law. It is justified if the possibility measure truly represents available information about the upper bounds of potential probabilities (e.g., $\Pi$ derived from imprecise observations constraining $P$). It can be problematic if $P$ and $\Pi$ are derived from entirely independent sources or model fundamentally different aspects of a problem.
    \item \textbf{Information Loss/Gain:} Transforming $P \to \Pi$ loses the precision of additivity. Transforming $\Pi \to P$ involves making assumptions (like maximum entropy or insufficient reason) to pick one $P$ out of a set of possibilities. The choice of transformation method itself is an assumption.
    \item \textbf{Semantic Alignment:} Transformations are most meaningful when probability and possibility are indeed modeling different facets of the \textit{same underlying uncertainty}. If they model completely unrelated concepts, applying formal transformations can be a category mistake, as the numbers, despite being in $[0, 1]$, have entirely different semantics.
\end{enumerate}
