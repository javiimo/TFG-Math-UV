\chapter{Results from Analysis for T-norms}

\section{Continuity of T-norms}
\label{app:cont_tnorms}
T-norms are real-valued functions of two variables defined over the compact domain $[0,1]^2$ with values in $[0,1]$, and they satisfy the monotonicity property (that is, $T(x,y) \le T(x',y')$ if $x \le x'$ and $y \le y'$). These properties greatly simplify the study of their continuity. This appendix presents key results from analysis concerning the continuity and semi-continuity of t-norms\footnote{These results also apply to t-conorms, as they do not depend on one or zero identity properties.}.

\begin{notation}{Equivalence of Norms on $\R^n$}
    On a finite-dimensional vector space (like $\mathbb{R}^n$), all norms are equivalent. This is, given any two norms $\|\cdot\|_a$ and $\|\cdot\|_b$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy

 $$
 \exists c, C > 0 \text{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \quad c\|x\|_a \leq \|x\|_b \leq C\|x\|_a.
 $$
 Since we are working on $\R^2$, the statements are equal for any given norm and we will denote it by \say{$\|\cdot\|$}.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[Continuity]
A t-norm $T$ is \emph{continuous at a point} $(x_0, y_0) \in [0,1]^2$ if:
\[
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : \forall (x,y) \in [0,1]^2, \|(x,y) - (x_0,y_0)\| < \delta \implies |T(x,y) - T(x_0,y_0)| < \epsilon
\]
\end{definition}

Intuitively, this means that the value $T(x,y)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $T(x_0,y_0)$ by choosing $(x,y)$ sufficiently close to $(x_0,y_0)$. A t-norm $T$ is \emph{continuous} if it is continuous at every point in its domain $[0,1]^2$.

\begin{definition}[Uniform Continuity]
A t-norm $T$ is \emph{uniformly continuous} if:
\[
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : \forall (x,y),(x',y') \in [0,1]^2, \|(x,y) - (x',y')\| < \delta \implies |T(x,y) - T(x',y')| < \epsilon
\]
\end{definition}
The key difference from pointwise continuity is that $\delta$ depends only on $\epsilon$, not on the specific location in the domain.
\begin{remark}
    Since the domain $[0,1]^2$ of a t-norm is a compact set, a t-norm $T$ is continuous if and only if it is uniformly continuous \cite[p.~30]{Klement2000}.
\end{remark}

Due to monotonicity, a t-norm's continuity over its 2D domain can be verified by checking continuity along its one-dimensional sections:
\begin{proposition}[Continuity via Components for Monotone Functions {\cite[Prop.~1.19]{Klement2000}}]
A t-norm $T$ (or any non-decreasing function on $[0,1]^2$) is continuous if and only if it is continuous in each variable separately. That is, for all fixed $x_0, y_0 \in [0,1]$, the functions $T(x_0, \cdot)$ and $T(\cdot, y_0)$ are continuous.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
Because of the commutativity, for a t-norm
its continuity is equivalent to its continuity in the first component.\cite[p.~16]{Klement2000}
\end{remark}

\section{Semi-continuity of T-norms}
\label{app:semicont-tnorms}

Many theoretical contexts such as fuzzy logic require only less restrictive properties than continuity, such as left-continuity or upper semi-continuity. The following sections present these definitions and derive their relationships using the properties of t-norms.


\begin{definition}[Semi-continuity for T-norms {\cite[Def.~1.20]{Klement2000}}]
    A t-norm $T$ is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Lower semi-continuous (LSC) at $(x_0,y_0)$} if:
        \[
        \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 :\, T(x,y) > T(x_0,y_0) - \epsilon \quad \forall (x,y) \in \left(]x_0 - \delta, x_0] \times ]y_0 - \delta, y_0]\right) \cap [0,1]^2
        \]
        \item \emph{Upper semi-continuous (USC) at $(x_0,y_0)$} if:
        \[
        \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 :\, T(x,y) < T(x_0,y_0) + \epsilon \quad \forall (x,y) \in \left([x_0, x_0 + \delta[ \times [y_0, y_0 + \delta[\right) \cap [0,1]^2
        \]
    \end{itemize}
    A t-norm is LSC (USC) if it is LSC (USC) at every point in $[0,1]^2$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{notation}{Topological semi-continuity}
        The definition above is only valid in metric spaces such as $\R^2$. The topological definitions are: $$T(x_0, y_0) \le \liminf_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} T(x,y) \text{ for LSC}$$   $$\text{and } T(x_0, y_0) \ge \limsup_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} T(x,y)\text{ for USC}$$
    \end{notation}
  
    Intuitively, lower semi-continuity means that the function's value does not have an isolated peak relative to its surroundings. More precisely, values $T(x,y)$ approaching from the \emph{bottom-left quadrant} are not significantly lower than $T(x_0,y_0)$. If there's a discontinuity, $T(x_0,
    y_0)$ is at the \emph{bottom} of an upward jump. Conversely, upper 
    semi-continuity means $T(x_0,y_0)$ is at the \emph{top} of a downward 
    jump.

\begin{definition}[One-Sided Continuity]
A t-norm $T$ is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Left-continuous in its first component at $(x_0,y_0)$} if:
    \[
    \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : \, |T(x,y_0) - T(x_0,y_0)| < \epsilon \quad \forall x \in ]x_0-\delta, x_0]
    \]
    \item \emph{Right-continuous in its first component at $(x_0,y_0)$} if:
    \[
    \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 :\, |T(x,y_0) - T(x_0,y_0)| < \epsilon \quad \forall x \in [x_0, x_0+\delta[, |T(x,y_0) - T(x_0,y_0)| < \epsilon
    \]
\end{itemize}
For the second component the definition is completely analogous.
$T$ is \emph{left-continuous} (or \emph{right-continuous}) if it is left-continuous (or right-continuous) in both components.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Let $T$ be a t-norm:
      \begin{align*}
        T \text{ continuous } &\Leftrightarrow T \text{ lower semi-continuous and upper semi-continuous} \\
        T \text{ continuous } &\Leftrightarrow T \text{ left-continuous and right-continuous}
      \end{align*}
\end{remark}


For general functions, semi-continuity and one-sided continuity are unrelated concepts, as semi-continuity is related to the function's range while one-sided continuity deals with domain limits. However, for monotone functions like t-norms, these properties are equivalent. This is particularly useful because one-sided continuity is often easier to establish or analyze from the construction of a t-norm.\\
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Prop.~1.22]{Klement2000}}]
For a t-norm $T$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T$ is lower semi-continuous if and only if $T$ is left-continuous.
    \item $T$ is upper semi-continuous if and only if $T$ is right-continuous.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

For Archimedean t-norms (those for which $T(x,x) < x$ for all $x \in ]0,1[$), an even stronger relationship between one-sided continuity and full continuity exists. This class of t-norms is fundamental in many applications.
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Prop.~2.16]{Klement2000}}]
  For an Archimedean t-norm $T$, the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)] $T$ is left-continuous.
      \item[(ii)] $T$ is continuous.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
This result significantly simplifies the verification of continuity for Archimedean t-norms. If such a t-norm is known to be left-continuous (e.g., due to properties of its additive or multiplicative generator, which are often easier to analyze for one-sided continuity), it is automatically fully continuous. This is a non-trivial property that does not hold for general monotone functions.

\subsection{Non-continuous T-norms}

While continuous t-norms are well-classified (section \ref{sec:class_tnorms}), not all t-norms are continuous, they can exhibit quite irregular continuity behavior:\\

The \textbf{drastic product $T_D$} is a key example of a non-continuous t-norm. It is Archimedean. It is upper semicontinuous, implying right-continuity in each variable. However, it is not left-continuous (e.g., at $(1,y)$ for $y<1$).\\

The \textbf{nilpotent minimum $T^{nM}$} is lower semicontinuous (left-continuous in each variable) but it is not right-continuous at points on the line $x+y=1$ when approached from $x+y>1$ \cite[Rem.~1.21(i)]{Klement2000}. It is defined as:
  \[
  T^{nM}(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } x+y \leq 1 \\
    \min(x,y) & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
  \]


The \textbf{Krause t-norm $T^K$} (\cite[App.~B.1]{Klement2000}) is a more complex example. It is constructed using the Cantor set and Farey series. It is neither left- nor right-continuous, but has a continuous diagonal section.

\signal{
\begin{remark}[Importance of Left-Continuity]
For non-continuous t-norms, the property of \emph{left-continuity} (in each variable) is often a desirable, or even required, condition in certain applications, particularly in fuzzy logic. For instance, in residuum-based logics, if a t-norm $T$ is left-continuous, its corresponding residuated implication $I(x,y) = \sup\{z \in [0,1] \mid T(x,z) \le y\}$ exhibits well-behaved properties. Specifically, a commutative, integral lattice-ordered monoid based on $T$ is residuated if and only if $T$ is left-continuous (\cite[Prop.~2.47, p.~63]{Klement2000}). This ensures that the implication adequately captures deductive reasoning. While the intuitive notion that "a microscopic decrease of the truth degree of a conjunct should not macroscopically decrease the truth degree of the conjunction" points towards continuity, left-continuity is a weaker but often sufficient condition for preserving logical coherence in such frameworks.
\end{remark}}

\section{Generators and continuous Archimedean T-norms}
\label{app:generators_tnorms}
Continuous archimedean t-norms can be elegantly characterized and constructed through the concept of generators. 
These representations emerged from studying functional equations, particularly the associativity equation
 $T(x, T(y,z)) = T(T(x,y),z)$. The study of this equation began with N. H. Abel's work in the 19th century. J. Acz√©l later advanced the theory through his research on functional equations. Important insights also came from P. S. Mostert, A. L. Shields, and C. H. Ling's work on topological semigroups \cite[Sec.~5.1]{Klement2000}. Though the theory behind functional equations and topological semigroups is beyond the scope of this work, these fields were essential in developing the theory of t-norm generators.\\

The core idea of a generator is to transform the t-norm operation on $[0,1]$ into a simpler arithmetic operation on a different domain, via a strictly monotonic function. For continuous Archimedean t-norms, the additive generator provides such a framework.

An \textbf{additive generator} \cite[Def.~3.25]{Klement2000} of a t-norm $T$ is a strictly decreasing function $t: [0,1] \to [0, \infty]$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $t(1) = 0$.
    \item $t$ is right-continuous at $0$.
\end{enumerate}
The t-norm $T$ is then constructed from its additive generator $t$ using the formula:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:additive_generator_t_norm}
    T(x,y) = t^{(-1)}( \min(t(0), t(x) + t(y)) )
\end{equation}
where $t^{(-1)}: [0, t(0)] \to [0,1]$ is the pseudo-inverse of $t$, defined as $t^{(-1)}(u) = \sup \{z \in [0,1] \mid t(z) \ge u \}$. The sum operation in equation \ref{eq:additive_generator_t_norm} is the reason why these generators are called \emph{additive}.

\begin{notation}{Multiplicative Generators}
    Parallel to additive generators, continuous Archimedean t-norms can also be represented using multiplicative generators \cite[Def.~3.36]{Klement2000}. The key differences are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A multiplicative generator $\theta$ is strictly \emph{increasing} (rather than decreasing)
        \item $\theta(1)=1$ (rather than $t(1)=0$)
        \item The formula analogous to Equation \ref{eq:additive_generator_t_norm} uses maximum and multiplication instead of minimum and addition:
        \[T(x,y) = \theta^{(-1)}(\max(\theta(0), \theta(x) \cdot \theta(y)))\]
        \item For strict t-norms, $\theta(0)=0$ (rather than $t(0)=\infty$)
        \item For nilpotent t-norms, $\theta(0) \in ]0,1[$ (rather than $t(0)$ finite)
    \end{itemize}
    The relationship between both types of generators is given by: \[\theta(x) = e^{-t(x)}\text{ and }t(x) = -\log(\theta(x))\]
    \end{notation}

    \begin{theorem}[Representation of Continuous Archimedean T-norms {\cite[Thm.~5.1]{Klement2000}}]
        A t-norm $T$ is a continuous Archimedean t-norm if and only if it possesses a continuous additive generator $t: [0,1] \to [0,\infty]$. This generator is unique up to a positive multiplicative constant.
      \end{theorem}
    
    This theorem is crucial because it guarantees that the entire class of continuous Archimedean t-norms can be characterized and constructed using these generator functions. Consequently, through the equivalence, they can also be represented by multiplicative generators \cite[Cor.~5.4]{Klement2000}.

The value $t(0)$ is particularly significant as it determines the nature of the continuous Archimedean t-norm \cite[Cor.~3.30]{Klement2000}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $t(0) = \infty$, then $\min(t(0), t(x) + t(y)) = t(x) + t(y)$, and the resulting t-norm $T$ is \textbf{strict} (e.g., for $t(x) = -\log(x)$, $T(x,y) = xy$, the product t-norm).
    \item If $t(0)$ is finite (i.e., $t(0) < \infty$), the resulting t-norm $T$ is \textbf{nilpotent} (e.g., for $t(x) = 1-x$, $T(x,y) = \max(0, x+y-1)$, the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm).
\end{itemize}
This representation via additive generators not only simplifies the study of continuous Archimedean t-norms but also provides a mechanism for constructing them, which is the idea behind the families of t-norms. The general approach involves:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Starting with a known generator function. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $t_L(x) = 1-x$, the additive generator for the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm ($T_L$).
        \item $t_P(x) = -\log x$, the additive generator for the Product t-norm ($T_P$).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Introducing one or more parameters (often denoted by $\lambda, p, \dots$) into the structure of this generator function to create a parameterized generator $t_\lambda(x)$.
    \item Applying the construction formula (Equation~\eqref{eq:additive_generator_t_norm}) with $t_\lambda(x)$ to obtain a parametric family of t-norms $T_\lambda(x,y)$.
\end{enumerate}
The properties of the resulting t-norm family (e.g., whether its members are strict or nilpotent, their continuity with respect to the parameter) depend on how the parameter affects $t_\lambda(0)$ and the overall shape of $t_\lambda$. Many well-known t-norm families are derived in this manner.


\begin{example}[Examples of T-norm Families]\label{ex:families_tnorms}
    Below are some families of continuous Archimedean t-norms, along with their definitions and key generator properties. These are extracted from \cite[App.~A]{Klement2000}.

    \textbf{1. Schweizer-Sklar T-norms} ($T_\lambda^{SS}$) for $\lambda \in [-\infty, \infty]$ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_\lambda^{SS}(x,y) = \begin{cases} T_M(x,y) & \text{if } \lambda = -\infty \\ T_P(x,y) & \text{if } \lambda = 0 \\ T_D(x,y) & \text{if } \lambda = \infty \\ (\max(x^\lambda + y^\lambda - 1, 0))^{1/\lambda} & \text{if } \lambda \in ]-\infty, 0[ \cup ]0, \infty[ \end{cases}$
    \item Additive generator (for $\lambda \in ]-\infty, 0[ \cup ]0, \infty[$): $t_\lambda^{SS}(x) = \frac{1-x^\lambda}{\lambda}$ (if $\lambda=0$, $t_0^{SS}(x) = -\log x$).
    \item $t_\lambda^{SS}(0) = \infty$ for $\lambda \in ]-\infty, 0]$, hence $T_\lambda^{SS}$ is strict.
    \item $t_\lambda^{SS}(0) = \frac{1}{\lambda} < \infty$ for $\lambda \in ]0, \infty[$, hence $T_\lambda^{SS}$ is nilpotent. ($T_\infty^{SS} = T_D$ is not Archimedean).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Hamacher T-norms} ($T_\lambda^H$) for $\lambda \in [0, \infty]$

    (Note: $T_0^H = T_P$)
    \item Additive generator (for $\lambda \in [0, \infty[$): $t_\lambda^H(x) = \log\left(\frac{\lambda + (1-\lambda)x}{x}\right)$ (if $\lambda=0$, $t_0^H(x)=\frac{1-x}{x}$).

    \item Additive generator (for $\lambda \in ]0, 1[ \cup ]1, \infty[$): $t_\lambda^F(x) = \log_\lambda \left(\frac{\lambda^x-1}{\lambda-1}\right)$. (For $\lambda=1$, $t_1^F(x) = -\log x$; for $\lambda=\infty$, $t_\infty^F(x) = 1-x$).
    \item $t_\lambda^F(0) = \infty$ for $\lambda \in [0, \infty[$, hence $T_\lambda^F$ is strict.
    \item $t_\infty^F(0) = 1 < \infty$, hence $T_\infty^F = T_L$ is nilpotent.

    (Note: $T_0^{SW} = T_L$)
    \item Additive generator (for $\lambda \in ]-1, \infty[$): $t_\lambda^{SW}(x) = 1 - \frac{\log(1+\lambda x)}{\log(1+\lambda)}$. (For $\lambda=0$, $t_0^{SW}(x)=1-x$; for $\lambda \to \infty$, $t_\infty^{SW}(x)=-\log x$).
    \item $t_\lambda^{SW}(0) = 1 < \infty$ for $\lambda \in ]-1, \infty[$, hence $T_\lambda^{SW}$ is nilpotent.
    \item $t_\infty^{SW}(0) = \infty$, hence $T_\infty^{SW} = T_P$ is strict.
