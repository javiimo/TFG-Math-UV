Fuzzy sets, as discussed in chapter \ref{ch:intro}, provide a way to encode data. In the case of MCDM  problems, we are particularly interested in modeling the vagueness of fuzzy attributes. In the previous chapter, the starting point always assumed a fuzzy set was given (defined by its membership function), and from there properties and operations were defined. However, there isn't a unique way to determine the membership value of an object to a fuzzy set:

Recovering the example of height from section \ref{sec:relations}, let us consider the set of tall people with membership function $\mu(x)$. It has already been discussed that this concept lacks sharp boundaries. But how can we assign membership values (degrees of compatibility between the concept tall and any given height value) to different heights?

A first simpler step, seems to assign those memberships to heights that 

In general it depends on the definition and the kind of information the fuzzy set encodes but in most of the applications, there will be choices to be made that won't come from a universal objective truth everyone agrees with (whose existance is a topic of philosophy, not addressed in this work) but rather from a more practical perspective often involving subjectivity. Instead of seeing this as a flaw and a lack of rigor, it can be considered a major advantage for mathematical models that need to take into account the opinion of stakeholders. It is only problematic when its  \\

\paragraph{Linguistic Variables}
1. Base Variable and Linguistic Values:
A linguistic variable (e.g., Age) is typically associated with a numerical base variable (e.g., the chronological age from 0 to 100).
The words or sentences that the linguistic variable can take (e.g., young, old, very young) are its linguistic values.
A linguistic value like young is interpreted as a label for a fuzzy restriction on the values of the base variable. This fuzzy restriction defines the meaning of the linguistic value.
2. Compatibility Function (The Meaning):
The meaning of a linguistic value is defined by a compatibility function. This function associates each value of the base variable with a number in the interval [0, 1].
This number represents the compatibility of the numerical value with the linguistic label. For example, the compatibility of the numerical age 28 with the linguistic value young might be 0.7, while the compatibility of age 35 might be 0.2 (p. 4, Fig. 1).
The paper explicitly states that compatibility is distinct from probability. It is a subjective measure of how well a numerical value fits a linguistic concept.
