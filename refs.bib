  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research paper presents a comprehensive review of Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods, encompassing their advancements, applications, and future directions. The study begins with an introduction emphasizing the significance of MCDM in complex decision-making scenarios. Through a systematic literature review, recent developments in MCDM techniques are examined, including multi-objective methods, fuzzy-based approaches, data-driven models, and hybrid methodologies. The strengths and limitations of each method are critically analyzed. Furthermore, the paper investigates the diverse applications of MCDM in domains such as business, engineering, environment, healthcare, and public policy, highlighting the practical implications through real-world case studies. The study then identifies emerging trends and challenges in MCDM research, discussing the integration of MCDM with emerging technologies, enhancing robustness and adaptability, addressing uncertainty, and identifying unexplored domains for potential application. This comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource for decision-makers and researchers, providing insights into the advancements, applications, and future directions of MCDM methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstract="The problem of converting possibility measures into probability measures has received attention in the past, but not by so many scholars. This question is philosophically interesting as part of the debate between probability and fuzzy sets. The imbedding of fuzzy sets into random set theory as done by Goodman and Nguyen (1985), Wang Peizhuang (1983), among others, has solved this question in principle. However the conversion problem has roots at least as much in the possibility/probability consistency principle of Zadeh (1978), that he proposed in the paper founding possibility theory.",

abstract = {When planning maintenance tasks involving the switching off of parts of the network, electricity transmission operators must evaluate and take into account the associated risks. The French operator, RTE, has developed a three-step approach in which they first calculate the risks in every possible scenario, then plan the maintenance tasks by optimizing some risk measures, and finally validate the plan. In this paper, we have addressed the second step, developing mathematical models that approximate the original problem as well as a matheuristic algorithm. It is composed of three phases, combining integer linear models in the first phase with metaheuristics such as Variable Neighbourhood Descent and Path Relinking in the second and third phases. The computational results obtained on the benchmarks provided by the company show that our algorithm improves on the best reported solutions for most of the test instances.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the convergence properties of an important class of multidimensional scaling algorithms. We unify and extend earlier qualitative results on convergence, which tell us when the algorithms are convergent. In order to prove global convergence results we use the majorization method. We also derive, for the first time, some quantitative convergence theorems, which give information about the speed of convergence. It turns out that in almost all cases convergence is linear, with a convergence rate close to unity. This has the practical consequence that convergence will usually be very slow, and this makes techniques to speed up convergence very important. It is pointed out that step-size techniques will generally not succeed in producing marked improvements in this respect.}

Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.}
