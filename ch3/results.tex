The final stage of our analysis involves applying the two-level aggregation model to the decision matrix to rank the 29 alternative schedules. The model's flexibility allows a decision-maker to articulate their preferences through two sets of parameters: a preference for seasonality (3 weights) and an overall attitude towards risk, defined by the orness value $\alpha$. To showcase the model's behavior, we present the results across a spectrum of these parameters. Figure \ref{fig:results_plot} visualizes the outcomes for four distinct seasonal scenarios: a singular focus on each of the three seasons, and an equal weighting for all. 

The weight vectors for (Winter, Summer, Inter-season) used in these scenarios are (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) for "Winter focus", (0.0, 1.0, 0.0) for "Summer focus", (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) for "Inter-season", and (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) for "Equal weights"

The orness parameter, $\alpha$, critically shapes the final ranking by controlling the OWA operator's behavior. As $\alpha$ approaches 0, the aggregation mirrors a \textit{min} operator, reflecting a pessimistic or risk-averse attitude. In this regime, the decision is driven by the worst-performing attribute for each alternative. Given that the `Highest Concurrency` scores (around 0.4) are numerically much lower than the fuzzy attribute scores (all above 0.9) or seasonality (around 0.6), it becomes the dominant criterion. Consequently, for low orness values, the model consistently selects solution \texttt{T3\_D700\_S33}, as it features the most favorable (i.e., lowest) highest concurrency.\\

Conversely, as $\alpha$ approaches 1, the OWA operator emulates a \textit{max} operator, reflecting an optimistic stance that judges an alternative by its strongest attribute. In this scenario, the model favors solutions that excel in at least one key area. The results show that for high orness values, solution \texttt{T3\_D700\_S73} is predominantly chosen because it achieves the highest score in "Risk Concurrency", which represents the most uniform distribution of high-risk interventions.\\

Across the four seasonal scenarios and the entire orness spectrum, a total of seven distinct solutions emerged as optimal at some point. It is noteworthy that six of these seven top-performing solutions were generated by the algorithm from Team 3, signaling its ability to produce robust and high-quality schedules. The exception, solution \texttt{T1\_D900\_S33} from Team 1, becomes the preferred choice under the "Inter-season focus" scenario for orness values slightly above 0.5, corresponding to a moderately optimistic viewpoint. Furthermore, our epsilon-lexicographic method for handling intra-block aggregation proved effective: across 23 instances where ties occurred based on the primary criterion, the rankings were successfully resolved through consideration of the second most relevant attribute in the hierarchical structure.\\

Our approach offers the significant advantage of being simple and intuitive, requiring the decision-maker to specify only a few high-level parameters rather than a complex set of weights. However, it is not without limitations. Since there are no significant gaps between the performance values of different solutions in the decision matrix, the resulting final aggregated scores are also very similar, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:results_plot}. The fuzzy attribute scores in our decision matrix are highly concentrated near 1, which can reduce the model's discriminatory power between alternatives that are very similar. This clustering also amplifies the influence of the "Highest Concurrency" attribute for pessimistic decision-makers, as its value range is distinctly separate from the others. Despite this, the model successfully provides a transparent framework for navigating trade-offs and supporting a final, justifiable decision.
