The presented optimization problem employs binary decision variables and a single aggregated objective function with crisp parameter values to provide a clear, tractable, and straightforward formulation. Such a representation is very practical due to its computational efficiency, interpretability, and ease of implementation using standard optimization solvers. However, this framework neglects the uncertainty, imprecision, and conflicting nature of  real-world criteria, such as varied stakeholder preferences, uncertain resource availability, or imprecise risk estimations. \\

However, this imprecise knowledge and information that the challenge providers have access to such as the physical location of each intervention or an interval for the possible risk values, is not public. To formulate our fuzzy MCDM problem, we will make minimal assumptions to extract meaningful information from the available data. These assumptions will help us reconstruct plausible attributes while maintaining the integrity of the original problem structure.\\

The analysis considers a pool of alternative schedules generated by three different algorithms that ranked among the top 5 solutions in the Roadef2020 challenge. These algorithms were developed by Buljubašić
and Vasquez\cite{top1}, Parreño et al.\cite{ConsueloRoadef}, and Langiu\cite{top5}, representing diverse approaches to solving the scheduling optimization problem.\\

The instance selected for running these 
algorithms is the \texttt{X12} from the dataset 
X provided by the challenge organizers. This instance is particularly interesting as it exhibited one of the largest performance gaps among all final evaluation round instances: the best solutions found with 90 minutes of computation time improved upon the 15-minute solutions by approximately 60 units in objective value, whereas most other instances showed improvements of only a few units. This significant gap suggests that \texttt{X12} is a more challenging instance where algorithms require more time to converge to high-quality solutions. By running our algorithms with varying time limits on this instance, we expect to obtain a diverse pool of solutions at different stages of convergence.\\

Each algorithm was ran with different maximum computation times (180s, 300s, 500s, 700s, and 900s) and three different random seeds (42, 33, 73) on a GIGABYTE AORUS 15 BSF laptop with a 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13700H CPU and 16GB of DDR5-4800 RAM.\\

This amounts to a total of 45 solutions (15 solutions per algorithm). However, the algorithm from Langiu failed to find feasible solutions in 4 of the setups, leaving a total of 41 solutions. The heat map (figure \ref{fig:dif_sol}) reveals that solutions 30-41 contain identical intervention schedules. Since these represent repeated solutions, only one representative (solution 30) will be kept, leaving us with 29 distinct solutions for analysis.
