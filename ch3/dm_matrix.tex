The presented optimization problem employs binary decision variables and a single aggregated objective function with crisp parameter values to provide a clear, tractable, and straightforward formulation. Such a representation is very practical due to its computational efficiency, interpretability, and ease of implementation using standard optimization solvers. However, this framework neglects the uncertainty, imprecision, and conflicting nature of  real-world criteria, such as varied stakeholder preferences, uncertain resource availability, or imprecise risk estimations. Some of these aspects are precisely what we aim to model in this chapter to help a single decision maker select a specific schedule from a pool of feasible solutions. \\

The following section provides a detailed explanation of how the decision matrix (see table \ref{tab:dm_matrix}) is obtained by defining their attributes and explaining how different schedules (solutions) were computed using 3 of the top performing algorithms from the competition.

\subsection{Alternative Generation}

The analysis evaluates a pool of alternative schedules obtained from three leading algorithms submitted to the Roadef2020 challenge. These algorithms were selected from among the 13 finalists as they were the only ones that had their compiled solution code publicly available. These top performing solutions include the overall winning algorithm by Buljubašić and Vasquez\cite{top1} (Team S34) which secured first place, the matheuristic by Parreño et~al.\cite{ConsueloRoadef} (Team S56) which ranked third overall, and the algorithm by Marco Langiu\cite{top5} (Team J73) which won the junior category and ranked fifth overall.\\



The winning algorithm (S34) employs a scenario-penalisation matheuristic, which begins by solving a relaxed version of the problem with low penalties for constraint violations. It then iteratively increases these penalties, gradually guiding the search from initially cheap but infeasible solutions towards high-quality, feasible ones. The third-place solution (S56) follows a structured three-phase pipeline: it first generates multiple diverse schedules using a randomized greedy construction, refines them with a systematic local search, and finally uses an exact solver to optimally re-plan only the most critical activities. In contrast, the junior-winning algorithm (J73) relies almost entirely on a single mathematical model (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming), with its competitiveness stemming from a very effective greedy heuristic used to generate a high-quality initial solution to dramatically accelerate the exact solver.\\

Each algorithm was ran on the instance \texttt{X12} with different maximum computation times (180s, 300s, 500s, 700s, and 900s) and three different random seeds (42, 33, 73) on a GIGABYTE AORUS 15 BSF laptop with a 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13700H CPU and 16GB of DDR5-4800 RAM. This amounts to a total of 45 solutions (15 solutions per algorithm). However, the algorithm from Langiu failed to find feasible solutions in 4 of the setups, leaving a total of 41 solutions. The heat map (figure \ref{fig:dif_sol}) reveals that solutions 30-41 contain identical intervention schedules. Since these represent repeated solutions, only one representative (solution 30) will be kept, leaving us with 29 distinct solutions for analysis.
